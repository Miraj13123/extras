## Definitions:

### **Number system**: 
---
A number system is a set of rules for representing numbers using a specific set of digits.

### **Numeral**: 
---
A numeral is a group of digits that represents a number.

`For Example, “4”, “55” are numerals that represent the numbers four and fifty-five.`

### **Number**: 
---
A number is a mathematical concept used to represent quantity or value. It is not a symbol — it’s a concept of quantity.

`For example, four or fifty-five indicates two quantities, no matter how it is written.`

### **Digit**: 
---
A digit is a single symbol used to build numerals. 

`For example, in the decimal system (base 10), the digits are 0 to 9`

```
Here’s you might have a confusion: Can a single digit be a numeral?

Answer: Yes, a single digit can also be a numeral if it is used to represent a number.

## Types of Number Systems:

### 1. Non-Positional number system:
---
A number system where the value of a digit does not depend on its position in the number. Each symbol has a fixed value.
`
Example:
XX means (in roman number system)
=10 + 10
=20
Here “X” means 10 regardless of its position
`

### 2. Positional number system:
---
A system where the value of a digit depends on both the digit and its position (or place) in the number, with each position representing a power of the system’s base.

`
Example:
512 means (in decimal)
=(5x10²) + (1x10¹) + (2x10⁰)
=(500 + 10 + 2)
Here “1” in ten’s place means different than in one's place.
`

**Base**: The base of a number system is the sum of the total digits it uses, starting from 0. 
`For example: Decimal has base 10 (digits 0–9)`
