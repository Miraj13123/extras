# 1. Download Clang Compiler

**Download Link**: [https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/releases](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/releases)

First enter the latest version available and then 
Download the file that includes [Clang + LLVM] both for your linux operating sytem.

As I'm writting this clang version is: 20.1.3

`clang+llvm-20.1.3-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.tar.xz`

# 2. Then Just Extract it with 7zip or any other app

- name the extracted folder as anything u want or keep it as it is
- and u can delete the .tar and .tar.xz files now

# 3. Set Environtment Variable Path
- Open the bin folder inside the extracted folder
- then copy the folder path or location

The path looks like this:
`......clang+llvm-20.1.3-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc/bin`

- search `"edit the system environment variables"`
- open `"edit the system environment variables"`
- In "advanced" tab click `"Environment Variables.."
- You will see two portion
- - One is User Variables (for the user you logged in as)
- - another portion of the window is System Variables (if you want clang for all windows users in your device)
- Now double-click the line that says "Path" 
- Then, in the prompted window choose new and paste the copied path
- Then click every ok button and exit
